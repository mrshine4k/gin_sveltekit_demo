Hello, This is my demo on using gin backend + SvelteKit/Daisyui/Tailwindcss frontend for simple ui, and basic rest api
Purely for demonstration purposes.

run the following commands to clone, install dependencies and run the project

```
git clone https://github.com/mrshine4k/gin_sveltekit_demo.git
cd gin_sveltekit_demo
npm install
```

# Running the project
```
npm start
```
The start command runs both the backend and the frontend server at the same time, meant for preparation of hosting the app on separate services.

# Running separate server for debugging

## Frontend
run the delevopment server on either
* https://127.0.0.1:5173/ 

    or
* https://localhost:5173/
```
npm run dev
```
## Backend
run the backend server on 
* https://localhost:9000
```
go run .
```
